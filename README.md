# Credit-Card-Fraud-GraphSAGE

### Credit Card Fraud Classification using Graph Neural Network

###### Objective of the project is to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a tutorial for those who wants to get acquainted with Graph Neural Network<br />
more specific to GraphSAGE<br />
Very few tutorials are available for data loading process for custom data<br />
Hyperparameters have been tuned but better tuning is possible<br />
A basic Graph Neural Network has been built<br />
For performance one can check the classification report and confusion matrix<br />
Class weights has not been used since performance is worse<br />
A balance between Precision and Recall was the main focus
